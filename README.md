# urlshortener

This Url Shortener application is built using:
* Node/Express
* React
* Bootstrap

To run the url shortener locally, please run the following commands:

```git clone git@github.com:khambro/urlshortener.git```

In the folder where the project was cloned, open two terminal windows. From the first window, run:

```cd urlshortener```\
```npm i```\
```npm start```

this should start the api server on localhost://8000.

from the second terminal window:

```cd urlshortener/client```\
```npm i```\
```npm start```

unless you have another application running locally on port 3000, you should be able to access the urlshortener at localhost://3000 and begin shortening valid URLs!
